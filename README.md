Group Final Project for ISM 6353. Team member: Elvina Sutislio, Yee Nuan Chan, Michael Dang

## **Motivation**
Maintaining a consistently high level of customer satisfaction stands as the primary objective for service-oriented businesses, as it results in increased profitability, reduced marketing costs, and improved reputation/brand image through word-of-mouth communications (Reichheld & Teal, 1996; Park & Wu, 2005). This is especially intense for the airline industry as competition continually intensifies (Alotaibi, 1992; Hussain, Nasser, & Hussain, 2015). 
Consequently, significant attention has been directed toward the primary determinant of customer satisfaction: service quality, given its paramount importance in the continued viability and competitiveness of any airline (Park & Wu, 2005). Acquiring insights into the role of airline services in shaping customer satisfaction is imperative for every airline, ensuring its long-term sustainability and competitiveness.

## **Business Problem**
For airlines to stay competitive in the airline industry, they must understand their customer profiles and levels of satisfaction among their customer bases.
